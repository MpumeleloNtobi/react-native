# React Native
An open-source JavaScript framework developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) in 2015.
### Purpose 
- Designed for cross-platform mobile application development using a single codebase, making apps feel and look like native platform applications.
### Mobile Device Native Languages
- Android: Uses Java and Kotlin as native programming languages.
- iOS: Uses Swift and Objective-C as native programming languages.
- HarmonyOS: <placeholder>
### React Native Language
- Written in JavaScript.
### Compilation 
- JavaScript in React Native doesnâ€™t directly compile into native languages; instead, it uses a "bridge" to interact with native components and APIs for a native user experience.

# React
- React native is built on top of react
